## Meal Rules
- [ ] **Breakfast:** Carbohydrates (e.g., oatmeal, sweet porridges, millet porridge).
- [ ] **Lunch:** Vegetables + Plant-based protein (legumes, chickpeas, tofu, beans, lentils). Do not combine with simple carbohydrates (sugars).
- [ ] **Dinner:** Vegetables (light, thermally processed).

## Beverages and Extras
- [ ] **Tea:** Drink black and green tea with added mandarin peel.
- [ ] **Plant milk:** Use conditionally (rarely/occasionally).
- [ ] **Honey:** Use conditionally (rarely).

## Restrictions
- [ ] **ABSOLUTE BAN:** The combination of Sugar + Flour + Fat.
- [ ] Avoid white sugar and simple sugars.
- [ ] Avoid flour (especially wheat/gluten).
- [ ] Avoid peanut butter.
- [ ] Avoid cheese (or consume in minimal amounts).

## Notes
These rules serve as the overriding filter for all recipes in the system. If a recipe in the database contains a "banned" ingredient (e.g., peanut butter), it should be skipped or substituted (e.g., with almond butter/tahini), unless it is a deliberate exception.
