## Survival Mode
Apply when you notice: shoulder tension, shallow breathing, mental chaos, anxiety.

## Practices
- [ ] **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale (4s) -> Hold (7s) -> Exhale (8s). Repeat 3-5 times.
- [ ] **Temperature reset:** Splash cold water on your face, alternate shower, or warm bath with magnesium salt.
- [ ] **Movement:** "Shake out" tension from the entire body for several minutes.
- [ ] **Grounding:** Walk barefoot on grass or floor.
- [ ] **Touch:** One hand on your heart, the other on your belly - feel your breath.
- [ ] **Silence:** 2 minutes of absolute silence or listening to nature sounds (birds).

## Mindset
- [ ] Ask in your journal: "What do I need right now?"
- [ ] Self-compassion: Tell yourself "I don't have to rush. I can slow down."

## Notes
The nervous system responds to safety signals. These practices help switch from "fight or flight" mode to "rest and digest."
