## Digestive Fire (Agni)
- [ ] **Ginger before a meal:** Eat a slice of fresh ginger with rock salt 15 minutes before eating.
- [ ] **Salt:** Use mineral/rock salt. Add *during* cooking (softens, hydrates); avoid salting finished dishes.
- [ ] **Digestive spices:** Cumin, coriander, fennel - drink CCF tea or add to dishes.
- [ ] **Asafoetida (Hing):** Add to legumes to prevent bloating.

## Balancing Vata
Especially recommended after travel or when "thrown off rhythm."
- [ ] Warm water as the first drink in the morning.
- [ ] Meditation and Nadhi Shodhana (alternate nostril) breathing.
- [ ] Abdominal massage: Circular motions clockwise (starting from the left groin).
- [ ] Regular consumption of Kitchari (mono-diet).

## Building Ojas (Life Essence)
- [ ] **Almonds:** Without skin, soaked overnight (must have).
- [ ] **Dates:** Fresh (not dried).
- [ ] **Ghee:** (In the non-vegan version) or high-quality oils.

## Notes
Agni (digestive fire) is the foundation of health in Ayurveda. Strong Agni = good digestion = good health. Weak Agni leads to Ama (toxins).
