# Spices in Ayurveda
category: health/ayurveda

## Rules
- [ ] Add rock/Himalayan salt during cooking (not after)
- [ ] Turmeric: Bitter, pungent, warming - cleanses blood and skin
- [ ] Ginger: Universal remedy, supports Agni (digestive fire)
- [ ] Ceylon cinnamon: Prefer over regular cinnamon
- [ ] Cardamom: Aids digestion, adds aroma
- [ ] Cumin: Warming, for legume dishes
- [ ] Coriander: Cooling, to balance spicy dishes
- [ ] Fennel: For digestion, bloating
- [ ] Garam Masala: Warming spice blend
- [ ] Vanilla: Sweet, cooling, sattvic (balances Vata and Pitta)

## Notes
Spices are best toasted in Ghee before adding other ingredients - this releases their properties.
