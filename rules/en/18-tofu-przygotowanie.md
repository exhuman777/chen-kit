# Tofu Preparation
category: diet/preparation

## Rules
- [ ] Drain and press out water before use
- [ ] Marinating: minimum 30 minutes, preferably overnight
- [ ] Marinade: soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger
- [ ] Fry on high heat until crispy
- [ ] Coat in cornstarch for crispiness
- [ ] Smoked tofu: more intense flavor, ready for direct use
- [ ] Kala Namak (salt): gives an "eggy" flavor

## Notes
Plain tofu is neutral - it absorbs the flavor of spices and marinades.
